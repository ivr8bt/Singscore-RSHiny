# Singscore-RSHiny
This is a tool that I built for my company that utilizes the BioConductor package "Singscore" to rank genes based on their expression in a data set. Genes that are more expressed receive a higher rank. The tool allows the user to input a number for the x number of top genes. For example, if the user were to input 50 then a .xslsx file will be created that shows the 50 highest ranking genes in the dataset. There is an additional component where the user can input a list of genes as a .xlsx file and a .xlsx file will be produced that shows the rank of each of those genes. This is a project that I worked on but the code is not available since it is proprietary information of AMPEL Biosolutions. The code is not publcicly available, but could be demonstrated on request.
